Materials around Early Graduate Research MATH 610

Early Graduate Research (EGR) is a course offered at Iowa State University 
in the Math department to get 1st and 2nd year students into research ideas as soon as possible.
In this class you are split up into groups and given a research topic to try and 
make progress on during the course of the semester.
You also meet with the instructor to learn the necessary background information.

My group for this class worked on Uncertainty Quantification for 
Hamilton Jacobi Equations using a Stochastic Galerkin Approach.
